### Authoring or modifying a skill

**You own the skill's voice.**

1. Write it in Claude Code's skill format (https://code.claude.com/docs/en/skills): a `SKILL.md` whose YAML frontmatter has a lowercase-hyphen `name` equal to its directory name and a `description` that says what it does and when to use it.
2. Validate the skill: frontmatter has `name` and `description`, referenced files exist, cross-skill links resolve.
3. Test cases if structural. Skip if subjective.
4. Run **Opening a PR**.

When in doubt, delete. Keep only prose that changes a decision. Tell it to do the thing and skip the reason. Explain only when the rule is confusing without one. Match tone to scope. Point at structural sources (types, READMEs, config) per the **encode-lessons-in-structure** principle skill. Delegate to other skills by path. Don't restate. A workflow you keep hitting but isn't captured → propose a new skill.

**Reply:** summary of the skill, key design decisions, validation notes.
